      "short": "We're two passionate sailors who have been navigating the waves since we were just 15. While we love sailing, boat provisioning has always been a hassle! We spent too much valuable holiday time searching for food, often lugging heavy bags filled with frozen and canned goods back to the boat instead of fresh local flavors. Navigating new islands while anchored felt like solving a puzzle. Plus, with limited storage, we frequently dealt with food waste, needing to refill supplies every few days.\n\nOne sunny morning, while enjoying breakfast on our deck, we had a lightbulb moment: \"What if there were a provisioning service to make life on the boat easier and more enjoyable?\" With our backgrounds in marketing, we decided to tackle this challenge for ourselves and fellow sailors. That's how Orange Dolphins was born! Our platform connects sailors with local food and beverage suppliers, making provisioning simple and fun.\n\nLast summer, we fell in love with the island of Leros and chose it as our pilot island, dreaming of expanding throughout the Dodecanese. Thank you for joining us on this adventure! Let's enjoy the rich flavors of the islands together, with our labrador Brownie by our side to keep our spirits high!",
      "long": "Hi there! We're Inna and Sigi, two passionate sailors who have been navigating the waves since we were just 15. Our love for sailing and exploring the stunning islands of Greece runs deep, but we've always found one thing rather frustrating: boat provisioning!\n\nPicture this: valuable holiday time spent searching for food, only to end up with frozen and canned goods from the nearest supermarket. We'd lug our heavy bags back to the boat, drenched in sweat, and often found ourselves needing to rent a car to find a shop or pay for pricey marinas while we would rather prefer those beautiful, less-crowded anchorages.\n\nEach island we visited was bursting with mouth-watering flavors: local fruits, fresh veggies, amazing wines, and fish that could make any meal shine. But navigating through a new place while anchored was like solving a puzzle! Dropping the dinghy down and fixing the motor, and lifting it all back up again was no small feat. And bulky water and drink deliveries? A total hassle unless you're tied up in a marina.\n\nThen there were the food waste issues! Fruits and veggies, meat and fish spoil so quickly, and our limited storage space made it impossible to stock up for a week of sailing. We absolutely love eating fresh and healthy food but found ourselves needing to refill supplies every couple of days.\n\nOne sunny day, while having breakfast on our deck with some friends, we had a lightbulb moment: \"What if there was a provisioning service that could make life on the boat a whole lot easier and more enjoyable?\" Someone out there had to solve this provisioning puzzle, right?\n\nThen it hit us — why not us? With our backgrounds in marketing and insights, we've helped numerous big brands grow, and we love tackling challenging tasks. So, why not take on the provisioning issue for us and our fellow sailors? And that's how the idea of Orange Dolphins was born.\n\nWe created a platform and an app designed to connect sailors like us with local food and beverage suppliers, making the whole provisioning process easy, effortless, and, dare we say, enjoyable! Last summer, we fell in love with the charming island of Leros and decided to keep our boat there, so naturally, we chose Leros as our pilot island with dreams of expanding to all the Dodecanese islands.\n\nThank you for choosing us to join you on your sailing adventures and for helping us make this pilot a success! Let's embrace the rich flavors of the islands together, with Brownie by our side, ensuring that every journey is filled with joy and laughter!",
